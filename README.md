A WIP program to allow me to control the GNOME desktop via the Leapmotion controller. Keys and mouse stuff are emulated using the xcb_test_fake_input functionality of the xcb library.


TODO:

- ~~Mouse pointer control via palm/fingertip position~~
- ~~Clicking by pinching/grabbing~~
- Palm facing straight/ up triggers overview
- Remappable keys via config file
- ~~Switch desktops via single finger swipe~~
- ~~Scroll by drawing circles with finger~~
